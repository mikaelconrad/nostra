# Cryptocurrency Investment Recommendation System - Architecture

## System Overview
This application is designed to help make investment decisions for cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, and Ripple) using neural networks and sentiment analysis. The system provides daily investment recommendations for 1, 7, and 30-day horizons based on historical data and market sentiment.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection Module
- **Historical Price Data**: Uses Yahoo Finance API to collect historical price data for BTC, ETH, and Ripple
- **Sentiment Data**: Uses Twitter API to collect social media sentiment data
- **Data Storage**: Stores collected data in structured formats for analysis
- **Data Update Mechanism**: Automatically updates data daily

### 2. Data Analysis Module
- **Price Analysis**: Analyzes historical price trends, volatility, and correlations
- **Technical Indicators**: Calculates technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Processes social media data to extract sentiment scores
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies relationships between price movements and external factors

### 3. Neural Network Prediction Module
- **Feature Engineering**: Prepares features for model training
- **Model Architecture**: Implements neural network models for price prediction
- **Training Pipeline**: Handles model training and validation
- **Prediction Engine**: Generates price predictions for multiple time horizons
- **Model Retraining**: Automatically retrains models with new data

### 4. Portfolio Management Module
- **Investment Tracking**: Tracks current investments and allocations
- **Transaction Recording**: Records buy/sell transactions and fees
- **Performance Calculation**: Calculates profit/loss and portfolio performance
- **Investment Simulation**: Simulates investment strategies based on predictions

### 5. Recommendation Engine
- **Strategy Formulation**: Develops investment strategies based on predictions
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates risk levels for different recommendations
- **Recommendation Generation**: Creates actionable investment recommendations
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks the accuracy of past recommendations
